            <h2>Soccer</h2>
            <p>I have been playing soccer since practically the day I learned to run.
                I have always been the smallest person on the team, but I fought to be the fastest 
                and most agressive player. Coined "Maddog", I played my heart out on the field and
                trained every day and night with my brother, my friends, my dad, and my coaches. Unfortunately,
                I, like many soccer players, tore my ACL early on in my soccer career and I never fully recovered.
                After years of rehabilitation and strength training, I am not the player I used to be. My senior year
                of high school I finally gave up playing competitively due to the stress I was putting on my body. In 
                order to stay close to the sport, I became the manager. I continue to play recreationally because
                this sport is a part of what defines me.

            <h2>Rugby</h2>
            <p>One of the perks of being tiny is agility. This played to my advantage in the game of touch rugby.
                Growing up in Singapore, I was introduced to this British sport in middle school and quickly fell in love with it. 
                For those unfamiliar with the sport, it is essentially tag with a ball. I was able to channel my inner child 
                and sprint down the field with everything I could give. I continued to play throughout middle school and high school
                before moving to Texas, where I can assure you they do not play touch rugby. This sport will also always be a part of me 
                in defining my youth.
